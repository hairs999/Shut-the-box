Probability of winning a game of shut the box

I've seen this game on tiktok called shut the box and I've been curious for ages about the probability of winning a game. 
This code specifically uses randomness, with no strategy involved. To extend the code, one could consider prioritising getting rid of random numbers first. 
Another extension could be to wait as long as possible to get rid of certain numbers. 

This uses the Monte Carlo method to predict the probability of winning a game of shut the box if you did not use strategy. 
The results show that there is a roughly 2.2% chance of winning. 
This is very low, indicating that randomness is not an optimal strategy.
